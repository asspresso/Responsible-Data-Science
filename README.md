# Responsible-Data-Science-Project

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we conduct a technical audit of an automated decision system (ADS) from Kaggle that evaluates hospital readmission rates for diabetic patients. Our primary objective is to address potential bias in the readmission process for diabetic patients, thus ensuring that hospitals provide appropriate care to those in need. Through this analysis, we aim to provide insights into the factors driving readmissions and assist clinicians and policymakers in identifying high-risk patients and devising interventions to prevent readmissions.
